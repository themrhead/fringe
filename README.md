# Fringe
Actor model exploration throught many frameworks, libs and tools.

The basic idea of this repo is to compile some implementations to explore Actor Model using real world examples.
## Inspiration
This repo name comes from Curitiba's Fringe. This Brazilian hosts a festival of arts, where among other things, Fringe crew (https://fringe.com.br/) inspire and gather some independent theater plays. They have more than 20 years setting and gathering a lot about theater.
